This script is designed to go through an input directory and move all files in an output directory sorted based on `birthtime` (creation date).

The script was developed and tested only on MacOS.

Usage: 
```sort.py -i <inputfile> <outputfile>```

Where: 
 * `inputfile` is the input directory
 * `outputfile` is the output directory
